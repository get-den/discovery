# Frontend (Svelte + Vite)

This is a minimal Svelte (no SvelteKit) frontend scaffold using Vite.

## Commands

- `npm install` — install dependencies
- `npm run dev` — start dev server on localhost
- `npm run build` — build for production into `dist/`
- `npm run preview` — preview the production build

## Notes

- Backend code and previous project files have been moved to `../backend`.
- Adjust API URLs in your Svelte code to point to your backend.
